Stock Market Prediction with Regression and Gradient Descent

This project explores the use of a regression model with gradient descent for stock market prediction. The model aims to identify relationships between historical market data and future price movements.

Components:

Regression Model: A statistical model is used to learn the relationship between input features (historical data) and the target variable (future stock price).
Gradient Descent: This optimization algorithm iteratively adjusts the model's parameters to minimize the prediction error, leading to improved accuracy over time.
Potential Benefits:

Identifying Trends: The model can potentially identify trends and patterns in historical data that might predict future price movements.
Data-Driven Approach: This method leverages historical data to make predictions, offering a data-driven approach to stock market analysis.
Limitations:

Market Volatility: Stock markets are inherently volatile, and historical data might not always perfectly predict future trends.
Overfitting: It's crucial to avoid overfitting the model to training data, which can lead to poor performance on unseen data.
Disclaimer: This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for making real-world investment decisions.

Further Exploration:

This project serves as a starting point for exploring machine learning techniques in stock market prediction. You can further explore:

Feature engineering - Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.
Different regression algorithms - Experimenting with other regression models like Random Forests or Support Vector Machines.
Model evaluation metrics - Implementing various metrics to assess the effectiveness of the prediction model.
